# Overview
This repo contains two trivial REST APIs (accounts with the path `'api/v1/accounts` and authorization with the path `v1/authorize`) implemented
using Java, Spring Boot 3.x. Each API can be started from the commandline using `gradle bootRun`. These two APIs use separate H2 file based database.

See [Accounts README](./accounts-service/README.md) and
[Authorization README](./authorization-service/README.md) for details.
